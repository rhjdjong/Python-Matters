# Introduction

Everybody who has worked with Python for a while,
and maybe followed some of the discussions on
e.g. [comp.lang.python](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/comp.lang.python),
will probably have encountered the phrase: “In Python, everything is an object,”
or something very similar. 
In this post I look closer at the meaning of this phrase,
and find that not only is it [objects all the way down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down) but also
objects all the way up.
