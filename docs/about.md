# About me

My name is Ruud de Jong. I have worked as software engineer, requirements engineer,
software architect and related positions at various companies.
For the major part of my career (1986 through 2001) I worked for Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs
(first AT&T) on software development for the 5ESS telephone exchange.

Over the past 40+ years I have used many different programming languages.
I started at university with Algol60, followed by APL and Fortran,
and of course there was the ubiquitous Basic on my hobby computers.
Later I worked with Pascal, C, C++, Java, and to a lesser extent C#, Lisp, Perl, and some others.
But my favourite language for the last 20 years or so is Python.

Why Python? For me it is the fact that Python allows me to focus on ideas, on algorithms, and on solutions,
without being sidetracked by boiler plate and administration.
And it still amazes me that in Python I can pick up work that I have not touched for several months,
and continue working on it as if I had only taken a lunch break.
I know other people have the same experience; I have seen this described as "Python fits my brain".

There are several aspects in Python that make this possible.
The lack of curly braces or other block delimiters is one of them;
forced indentation helps me to quickly grasp the structure of a program.
Another aspect is the almost complete lack of "magic".
By that I mean things like special names,
like C# "get" and "set" for property getters and setters,
or a C-function "main" that is the starting point for a program.
Python has its own magic, of course, but that magic is low-key (leading and trailing double underscores)
and somehow that does not intrude in everyday programming.

And Python is the only programming language
I know of that presents an almost leakfree abstraction of the underlying computer
(see the [law of leaky abstractions](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/)).
That means that, unless I use platform-specific modules or extensions, my program developed on Linux
will just work under Windows, and vice-versa.

Because of my enthousiasm for Python, and becasue I continue to gain new insights in how
Python works, I decided to write down what I found in this blog,
in the hope that other people find it useful.
Have fun!
